# Yugioh Pack Opener

## Description

A digital card-pack opener based on the cardgame Yu-Gi-Oh.
This is a passion project that I've build within 2 days during the HackReactor Software Engineering Immersive Program.
The goal of this project was to create a tool for players who are interested in playing any type of draft formats.
The web application allows users to register and then open packs and save the cards from the packs to their account.

## Setup

run below command in the root directory before running the application
> npm install

run below command to start application
> npm start

You can access the application on in your browser with localhost:3030 or http://127.0.0.1:3030/

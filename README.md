A digital card-pack opener based on the cardgame Yu-Gi-Oh.
This is a passion project that I've build during the HackReactor Software Engineering Immersive Program.
The goal of this project was to create a tool for players who are interested in playing any type of draft formats.
The web application allows users to register and then open packs and save the cards from the packs to their account.

This project was build with below technologies:

- Express.js
- Fireabase
- React
- React-Router
